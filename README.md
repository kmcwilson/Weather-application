# Challenge 6 weather application

## Description

This is a weather application that allows users to search a specific location and be provided with the current and future weather forecast for that city. When the user clicks on the page they will be able to search the city of their choice and the page will be filled with the weather information. The temperature is recorded in degrees celsius and there will be a weather icon that will show the current conditions. The user will see their previous searches under the bar and is able to click on these searches in order to review a past city. All of this is stored in local storage as well.
